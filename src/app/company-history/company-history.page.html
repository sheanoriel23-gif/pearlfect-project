    <h2>About Pearlfect Milktea</h2>
    <p>
      Pearlfect Milktea began with a simple goal: to bring happiness in every cup through freshly brewed tea, creamy blends, and chewy pearls made with love. 
      Established in 2021 in Quezon City, the brand was created by milk tea lovers who wanted to share their passion for quality and flavor. 
      From a small idea shared among friends, Pearlfect Milktea grew into a local favorite known for its warm service, cozy atmosphere, and dedication to perfecting every drink.
    </p>

    <p>
      What began as a small neighborhood stall has now grown into a well-loved brand known for its premium ingredients, unique flavors, 
      and friendly service. Pearlfect Milktea continues to spread smiles, one sip at a time.
